<h3>Spider-Man, or Peter Parker, is a young superhero from Marvel Comics who gains spider-like powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Despite his extraordinary abilities—like wall-climbing, web-shooting, and super agility—Peter struggles with normal teenage life and responsibilities. He learns a powerful lesson from his Uncle Ben: “With great power comes great responsibility.” Spider-Man’s story is about courage, sacrifice, and doing the right thing, even when it's hard, which is why he's one of the most relatable and loved superheroes.</h3>
